      <h1>Basically, Web Workers&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ¤– </h1>
      <p>Web Workers are little helper scripts that are executed <em>off the main thread</em> of your browser and therefore don't block things, particularly the current active document, or the DOM.</p>
      <p>To see what this looks like <em>inreallife</em>, click the button below to perform a complex calculation <em>in the browser</em>, and then contrast it with performing the <em>same calculation</em> in a worker, while observing this GIF.</p>

    <main>
      <img alt="Demo Image" src="barack.gif">
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <td class="table__left">Action</td>
          <td>Status</td>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><button class="js-action__run-in-browser">Run in Browser</button></td>
          <td class="js-result__browser"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><button class="js-action__run-in-worker">Run in Worker</button></td>
          <td class="js-result__worker"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Notice how speed-wise, it doesn't really vary very much. In fact, in most cases, it is actually <em>slower</em> to execute a worker because it is quite expensive to copy over a dataset from the browser into a worker, and then back from a worker into the browser. That said, workers <em>really</em> help <em>not annoy your users with slow, blocking processing.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Further reading:</strong> there's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker">more kinds of workers and a lot more to read and explore</a>. I hope this helped you!</p>
